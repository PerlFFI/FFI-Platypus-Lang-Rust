NAME
    FFI::Platypus::Lang::Rust - Documentation and tools for using Platypus
    with the Rust programming language

SYNOPSIS
    Rust:

     #![crate_type = "dylib"]
 
     // compile with: rustc add.rs
 
     #[no_mangle]
     pub extern "C" fn add(a:i32, b:i32) -> i32 {
       a+b
     }

    Perl:

     use FFI::Platypus;
     my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new;
     $ffi->lang('Rust');
     $ffi->lib('./libadd.so');
 
     $ffi->attach( add => ['i32', 'i32'] => 'i32' );
 
     print add(1,2), "\n";  # prints 3

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides native Rust types for FFI::Platypus in order to
    reduce cognitive load and concentrate on Rust and forget about C types.
    This document also documents issues and caveats that I have discovered
    in my attempts to work with Rust and FFI.

    This module is somewhat experimental. It is also available for adoption
    for anyone either sufficiently knowledgeable about Rust or eager enough
    to learn enough about Rust. If you are interested, please send me a pull
    request or two on the project's GitHub.

    Note that in addition to using pre-compiled Rust libraries, you can
    bundle Rust code with your Perl distribution using
    Module::Build::FFI::Rust.

CAVEATS
    In doing my testing I have been using the pre-release 1.0.0 Alpha
    version of Rust. Rust is a very fast moving target! I have rarely found
    examples on the internet that still work by the time I get around to
    trying them. Fast times. Hopefully when it becomes stable things will
    change.

  name mangling
    Rust names are "mangled" to handle features such as modules and the fact
    that some characters in Rust names are illegal machine code symbol
    names. For now that means that you have to tell Rust not to mangle the
    names of functions that you are going to call from Perl. You can
    accomplish that like this:

     #[no_mangle]
     pub extern "C" fn foo() {
     }

    You do not need to add this decoration to functions that you do not
    directly call from Perl. For example:

     fn bar() {
     }
 
     #[no_mangle]
     pub extern "C" fn foo() {
       bar();
     }

METHODS
    Generally you will not use this class directly, instead interacting with
    the FFI::Platypus instance. However, the public methods used by Platypus
    are documented here.

  native_type_map
     my $hashref = FFI::Platypus::Lang::Rust->native_type_map;

    This returns a hash reference containing the native aliases for the Rust
    programming languages. That is the keys are native Rust types and the
    values are libffi native types.

EXAMPLES
    See the above "SYNOPSIS" or the "examples" directory that came with this
    distribution.

SUPPORT
    If something does not work as advertised, or the way that you think it
    should, or if you have a feature request, please open an issue on this
    project's GitHub issue tracker:

    <https://github.com/plicease/FFI-Platypus-Lang-Rust/issues>

CONTRIBUTING
    If you have implemented a new feature or fixed a bug then you may make a
    pull reequest on this project's GitHub repository:

    <https://github.com/plicease/FFI-Platypus-Lang-Rust/issues>

    Caution: if you do this too frequently I may nominate you as the new
    maintainer. Extreme caution: if you like that sort of thing.

    This project's GitHub issue tracker listed above is not Write-Only. If
    you want to contribute then feel free to browse through the existing
    issues and see if there is something you feel you might be good at and
    take a whack at the problem. I frequently open issues myself that I hope
    will be accomplished by someone in the future but do not have time to
    immediately implement myself.

    Another good area to help out in is documentation. I try to make sure
    that there is good document coverage, that is there should be
    documentation describing all the public features and warnings about
    common pitfalls, but an outsider's or alternate view point on such
    things would be welcome; if you see something confusing or lacks
    sufficient detail I encourage documentation only pull requests to
    improve things.
