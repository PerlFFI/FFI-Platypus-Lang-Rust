# ABSTRACT: Documentation and tools for using Platypus with the Rust programming language
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Rust:

# EXAMPLE: examples/add.rs

Perl:

# EXAMPLE: examples/add.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides native Rust types for L<FFI::Platypus> in order to
reduce cognitive load and concentrate on Rust and forget about C types.
This document also documents issues and caveats that I have discovered
in my attempts to work with Rust and FFI.

This module is somewhat experimental.  It is also available for adoption
for anyone either sufficiently knowledgeable about Rust or eager enough
to learn enough about Rust.  If you are interested, please send me a
pull request or two on the project's GitHub.

Note that in addition to using pre-compiled Rust libraries, you can
bundle Rust code with your Perl distribution using L<FFI::Build> and
L<FFI::Build::File::Cargo>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The examples in this discussion are bundled with this distribution and
can be found in the C<examples> directory.

=head3 Notes

Basic types like integers and floating points are the easiest to pass
across the FFI boundary.  The Platypus Rust language plugin (this module)
provides the basic types used by Rust (for example: C<bool>, C<i32>, C<u64>,
C<f64>, C<isize> and others) will all work as a Rust programmer would expect.
This is nice because you don't have to think about what the equivalent types
would be in C when you are writing your Perl extension in Rust.

Rust symbols are "mangled" by default, which means that you cannot use
the name of the function from the source code without knowing what the
mangled name is.  Rust provides a function attribute C<#[no_mangle]>
which will tell the compiler not to mangle the name, making lookup of
the symbol possible from other programming languages like Perl.

Rust functions do not use the same ABI as C by default, so if you want
to be able to call Rust functions from Perl they need to be declared
as C<extern "C"> as in this example.

We also set the "crate type" to C<cdylib> in the first line to tell the
Rust compiler to generate a dynamic library that will be consumed by
a non-Rust language like Perl.

=head3 Notes

Strings are considerably more complicated for a number of reasons,
but for passing them into Rust code the main challenge is that the
representation is different from what C uses.  C Uses NULL terminated
strings and Rust uses a pointer and size combination that allows
NULLs inside strings.  Perls internal representation of strings is
actually closer to what Rust uses, but when Perl talks to other
languages it typically uses C Strings.

Getting a Rust string slice C<&str> requires a few stems

=over 4

=item We have to ensure the C pointer is not C<NULL>

We return C<-1> to indicate an error here.  As we can see from the
calling Perl code passing an C<undef> from Perl is equivalent to
passing in C<NULL> from C.

=item Wrap using C<Cstr>

We then wrap the pointer using an C<unsafe> block.  Even though
we know at this point that the pointer cannot be C<NULL> it could
technically be pointing to uninitialized or unaddressable memory.
This C<unsafe> block is unfortunately necessary, though it is
relatively isolated so it is easy to reason about and review.

=item Convert to UTF-8

If the string that we passed in is valid UTF-8 we can convert
it to a C<&str> using C<to_str> and compute the length of the
string.  Otherwise, we return -2 error.

=head2 Returning allocated strings

=head3 Rust Source

# EXAMPLE: examples/string/return/return.rs

=head3 Perl Source

# EXAMPLE: examples/string/return/return.pl

=head3 Execute

 $ rustc return.rs
 $ perl return.pl
 ðŸ’£ na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na Batman! ðŸ’£

=head3 Notes

The big challenge of returning strings from Rust into Perl is
handling the ownership.  In this example we have a C API implemented
in Rust that returns a C NULL terminated string, but we have to
pass it back into Rust in order to deallocate it when we are done.

Unfortunately Platypus' C<string> type assumes that the callee
retains ownership of the returned string, so we have to get the
pointer instead as an C<opaque> so that we can later free it.
Before freeing it though we cast it into a Perl string.

In order to hide the complexities from caller of our
C<theme_song_generate> function, we use a function wrapper to
do all of that for us.

(This example is based on one provided in the
L<Rust FFI Omnibus|http://jakegoulding.com/rust-ffi-omnibus/string_return/>)

=head2 Returning allocated strings, but keeping ownership

=head3 Rust Source

# EXAMPLE: examples/string/return/keep.rs

=head3 Perl Source

# EXAMPLE: examples/string/return/keep.pl

=head3 Execute

 $ rustc keep.rs
 $ perl keep.pl
 ðŸ’£ na Batman! ðŸ’£
 ðŸ’£ na na Batman! ðŸ’£
 ðŸ’£ na na na Batman! ðŸ’£
 ðŸ’£ na na na na Batman! ðŸ’£
 ðŸ’£ na na na na na Batman! ðŸ’£
 ðŸ’£ na na na na na na Batman! ðŸ’£
 ðŸ’£ na na na na na na na Batman! ðŸ’£
 ðŸ’£ na na na na na na na na Batman! ðŸ’£
 ðŸ’£ na na na na na na na na na Batman! ðŸ’£
 ðŸ’£ na na na na na na na na na na Batman! ðŸ’£

=head3 Notes

For frequently called functions with smaller strings it may make more
sense to keep ownership of the string and just return a pointer.  Perl
makes its own copy on return anyway when you use the C<string> type.

In this example we use thread local storage to keep the C<CString>
until the next call when it will be freed.  Since we are using thread
local storage, it should even be safe to use this interface from a
threaded Perl program (although you should probably not be using
threaded Perl).

=head1 ADVANCED

=head2 panics

Be careful about code that might C<panic!>.  A C<panic!> across an FFI
boundary is undefined behavior.  You will want to catch the panic
with a C<catch_unwind> and map to an appropriate result.

 use std::panic::catch_unwind;
 
 #[no_mangle]
 pub extern fn oopsie() -> u32 {
     let result = catch_unwind(|| {
         might_panic();
     });
     match result {
         OK(_) => 0,
         Err(_) -> 1,
     }
 }

=head2 structs

You can map a Rust struct to a Perl object by creating a C OO layer.
I suggest using the C<c_void> type aliased to an appropriate name so
that the struct can remain private to the Rust code.

For example, given a Foo struct:

 struct Foo {
     ...
 }
 
 impl Foo {
     fn new() -> Foo { ... }
     fn method1(&self) { ... }
 }

You can write a thin C layer:

 type CFoo = c_void;
 
 #[no_mangle]
 pub extern "C" fn foo_new(_class *const i8) -> *mut CFoo {
     Box::into_raw(Box::new(Foo::new())) as *mut CFoo
 }
 
 #[no_mangle]
 pub extern "C" fn foo_method1(f: *mut CFoo) {
     let f = unsafe { &*(f as *mut Foo) };
     f.method1();
 }
 
 #[allow(non_snake_case)]
 #[no_mangle]
 pub extern "C" fn foo_DESTROY(f: *mut CFoo) {
     unsafe { drop(Box::from_raw(f as *mut Foo)) };
 }

Which can be called easily from Perl:

 package Foo {
 
     use FFI::Platypus 1.00;
     my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new( api => 1, lang => 'Rust' );
     $ffi->bundle; # see FFI::Build::File::Cargo for how to bundle
                   # your rust code...
     $ffi->type( 'object(Foo)' => 'CFoo' );
     $ffi->mangler(sub {
         my $symbol = shift;
         "foo_$symbol";
     });
     $ffi->attach( new     => [] => 'CFoo' );
     $ffi->attach( method1 => ['CFoo'] );
     $ffi->attach( DESTROY => ['CFoo'] );
 };
 
 my $foo = Foo->new;
 $foo->method1;
 # $foo->DESTROY implicitly called when it falls out of scope

=head2 returning strings

Passing in strings is not too hard, you can convert a Rust C<CString> into a Rust C<String>.
Return a string is a little tricky because of the ownership model.  Depending on how your
API works there are probably lot of approaches you might want to take.  One approach would
be to use thread local storage to store a C<CString> which you return.  It wastes a little
memory because once the string is copied into Perl space it isn't used again, but at least
it doesn't leak memory since it will be freed on the next call to your function.  Best of all
it doesn't require an C<unsafe> block.

 pub extern "C" fn return_string() -> *const i8 {
     thread_local! {
         static KEEP: RefCell<Option<CString>> = RefCell::new(None);
     }
 
     let my_string = String::from("foo");
     let c_string = CString::new(my_string).unwrap();
     let ptr = c_string.as_ptr();
     KEEP.with(|k| {
         *k.borrow_mut() = Some(c_string);
     });
 
     ptr
 }

From Perl:

 use FFI::Platypus 1.00;
 my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new( api => 1, lang => 'Rust' );
 $ffi->bundle;
 $ffi->attach( return_string => [] => 'string' );

=head2 callbacks

Calling back into Perl from Rust is easy so long as you have the correct
types defined.  Consider a Rust function that takes a C function pointer:

# EXAMPLE: examples/callback.rs

This can be called with a closure from Perl:

# EXAMPLE: examples/callback.pl

Which outputs:

 $ perl callback.pl
 log> Hello from rust!
 log> Something else.
 log> The last log line

=head1 METHODS

Generally you will not use this class directly, instead interacting with
the L<FFI::Platypus> instance.  However, the public methods used by
Platypus are documented here.

=head2 native_type_map

 my $hashref = FFI::Platypus::Lang::Rust->native_type_map;

This returns a hash reference containing the native aliases for the Rust
programming languages.  That is the keys are native Rust types and the
values are libffi native types.

=cut

sub native_type_map
{
  require FFI::Platypus;
  {
    u8       => 'uint8',
    u16      => 'uint16',
    u32      => 'uint32',
    u64      => 'uint64',
    i8       => 'sint8',
    i16      => 'sint16',
    i32      => 'sint32',
    i64      => 'sint64',
    binary32 => 'float',    # need to check this is right
    binary64 => 'double',   #  "    "  "     "    "  "
    f32      => 'float',
    f64      => 'double',
    bool     => 'sint8',    # in practice, but not guaranteed by spec
    usize    => FFI::Platypus->type_meta('size_t')->{ffi_type},
    isize    => FFI::Platypus->type_meta('ssize_t')->{ffi_type},
  },
}

=head1 EXAMPLES

See the above L</SYNOPSIS> or the C<examples> directory that came with
this distribution.  This distribution comes with a whole module example
of a full object-oriented Rust/Perl extension including C<Makefile.PL>
Rust crate, Perl library and tests.  It lives in the C<examples/Person>
directory, or you can browse it on the web here:

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item The C<bool> type

As of this writing, the C<bool> type is in practice always a signed
8 bit integer, but this has not been guaranteed by the Rust specification.
This module assumes that it is a C<sint8> type, but if that ever
changes this module will need to be updated.
