{{$NEXT}}
  - Fixed documentation error that was listing Rust source
    twice instead of the Rust and Perl source as it should
    have done (gh#43, gh#44)

0.16      2023-06-14 17:05:55 -0600
  - use `*std::os::raw::c_char` instead of `*i8` for strings,
    as this is more portable.  In particular *u8 or *c_char
    is expected on Linux Arm64. (gh#42)

0.15      2023-02-21 08:05:34 -0700
  - Bump Alien::Rust prereq to 0.03 for better handling
    of rust home.

0.14      2023-02-16 06:16:37 -0700
  - Use Alien::Rust if rustc and cargo are not already
    installed (gh#39, gh#40)

0.12      2022-10-27 21:54:54 -0600
  - Documentation improvements (gh#38)

0.11      2022-10-26 05:57:14 -0600
  - Fix bug where FFI::Build::File::Cargo would usually exit
    on failure instead of die, which in dev / prove mode would
    throw away any diagnostics (gh#37)

0.10      2022-10-23 19:39:14 -0600
  - Documentation improvements (gh#5, gh#17, gh#22, gh#28,
    gh#31, gh#32, gh#35)
  - Adding bool type.  As noted in the CAVEATS, this is in
    practice always a sint8, but not technically guaranteed
    by the spec (gh#25, gh#33)
  - Use cdylib in examples and in implementation as that is
    preferred for calling from C now (gh#16, gh#31)
  - Tests are build with --release by default, just like the
    runtime cdylib, so that the Rust code doesn't have to be
    compiled twice (gh#26, gh#30)
  - The PERL_FFI_CARGO_FLAGS environment variable can be used
    to change the flags passed into cargo test and cargo build
    this way you can use a different profile if you choose
    (gh#30)
